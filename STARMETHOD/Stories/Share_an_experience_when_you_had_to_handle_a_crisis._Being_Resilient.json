    "question": "Share an experience when you had to handle a crisis.",
    "situation": "Our marketing campaign for a new product launch crashed the day before it was scheduled to go live. The website server went down, pre-orders were inaccessible, and social media was buzzing with negative comments from eager customers.",
    "task": "My immediate task was threefold: restore the website functionality and pre-order access ASAP, manage the escalating negative social media commentary, and identify the root cause of the server crash to prevent recurrence.",
    "action": "I immediately assembled a cross-functional crisis team comprising IT specialists, customer service representatives, and social media managers.  We divided and conquered: IT worked tirelessly to diagnose and fix the server issue while I drafted a sincere apology and update for social media, acknowledging the problem and promising timely updates. Simultaneously, customer service addressed individual complaints and pre-order inquiries through alternative channels like email and phone.  Once the website was back online, we extended the pre-order period by 24 hours as a goodwill gesture and offered a small discount to compensate for the inconvenience.  To identify the root cause, I collaborated with IT to review server logs and implement additional safeguards to prevent similar incidents.",
    "result": "Within 12 hours, we had the website and pre-orders back online.  The proactive communication and compensatory actions effectively mitigated the negative social media sentiment, turning it largely positive.  Pre-orders actually exceeded our initial projections by 15% by the end of the extended period.  The post-mortem analysis revealed a critical system vulnerability, which we promptly patched, ensuring long-term website stability and preventing future crashes.  This experience reinforced the importance of cross-functional collaboration, proactive communication, and swift action in crisis management.",
